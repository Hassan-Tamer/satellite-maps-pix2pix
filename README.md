# Pix2Pix: Satellite to Maps Translation

This repository contains an implementation of the Pix2Pix model for translating satellite images into maps. The model is trained on a dataset of paired satellite images and corresponding map images.

## Overview
Pix2Pix is a type of generative adversarial network (GAN) used for image-to-image translation tasks. In this project, we aim to convert satellite images into map images by training a model that learns the mapping between these two domains.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of paired images:
- **Satellite Images**: The source images.
- **Map Images**: The target images.
